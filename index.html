      <h2><img src="img/idea.png" alt=""> Our Idea</h2>
      <p>
        To us, Firkintun is more than just a platform &mdash; Firkintun is
        the place we call <em>home</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firkintun the "place" is home to sippers everywhere. Forget about
        Bro Sixpack trying to get hammered on $2 Bud Lights; Firkintun
        is inhabited by those who value the <em>sip</em> and the <em>savor</em>
        over the slam and the slosh. It's a place for individuals equally
        passionate about the IBUs in their beer, the caramel notes in their
        whiskey, or the tannins in their wine. Most of all, in Firkintun, you
        can sip and savor with other like-minded individuals: sippers just
        like you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firkintun the "platform" is an objective search engine that connects
        its Citizens and their friends to the savor-worthy venues around them.
        Whether in unfamiliar territory or right down the road, Firkintun helps
        its Citizens, the sippers of the world, find the <em>experience</em>
        they're looking for. Yelp and Google can tell you what's nearby &mdash;
        Firkintun gives you the information you need to choose the best
        location for your perfect night out.
